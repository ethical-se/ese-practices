"Case for Ethics
This standard provides advisory and normative requirements for ethically aligned design activities. It is highly desirable, however, that the effort, resources and time spent, as well as evidence and outcomes attained in the course of implementing the requirements and the spirit of this standard, are recorded, consolidated, structured and presented in an adequate, consistent, and coherent narrative: a Case for Ethics. The Case for Ethics is a project memory and an auditable repository. Similar to a safety case, the Case for Ethics is intended to provide a structured account of the ethical and technical activities undertaken in the course of pursuing an ethically aligned design for the SOI. The Case for Ethics is a key contribution toward the organizational memory and maturity in ethically aligned design and a foundational information product for assessments.

The structure, contents, and arguments pertinent to a final claim for an ethically aligned design should be developed in an evolutionary manner throughout the life of a system. The Case for Ethics encourages the process outputs, evidence, and outcomes to be recorded at each stage of the ethically aligned design to provide a process or project repository and memory as well as a structured argument for the ethicality of the product, service or system. It constitutes indispensable inputs into any subsequent ethics assessment for the SOI and the organization.

The following content is recommended for the Case for Ethics for a given SOI. It serves as a checklist that can be satisfied by the organizationâ€™s content mapping, templates and information models. This outline is not intended to address all possible contents, or to mandate the title of the information item, nor the order or titles of the sections in documents presenting some or all of the contents of the Case for Ethics."
