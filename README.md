# ethical-software-engineering (ESE)
*TL;DR:* [IEEE Std. 7000](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9536679) meets Agile practices
(note: access to IEEE Std. 7000 is free after registration for IEEE Xplore).

## Motivation

<!-- TODO (v2) cite form CoC preamble (see ETHICOMP presentation notes) -->

Ethical Software Engineering (ESE) is for you if: 

1. You see yourself as a socially responsible software engineer. <!--, not just a "code monkey".[^1] -->
2. You see the risk that the software under construction may have undesired and/or unexpected and/or unjustified effects for one or more of its stakeholder groups and want to manage and mitigate this risk.  
3. You look for a set of essential, as-light-as-possible practices that increase the chances of your project or product development effort becoming compliant with IEEE Std. 7000. 

<!-- [^1]: "Code monkey" is a term used by Martin Fowler in presentations on the topic. We use it here under the assumption that monkeys will not feel discriminated by this term. -->

ESE targets any software engineer[^2] who wishes to create ethically valuable software, agile teams in particular. Its motivating themes are:[^1]

* *Synergies:* A value- and risk-based approach to design is very much at the heart of agile methods; for instance, [Extreme Programming](https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/xp) aims at balancing cost, time, quality and scope variables. <!-- Sources: "Extreme Programming Explained" by Kent Beck and the "iron cross" discussion in "Clean Agile" by Robert C. Martin -->  
* *Dual relation:* Agile practices may promote social responsibility and ethical behavior, but may also harm ethical values. The devil is in the detail, software usage context matters. 
* *Novelty:* The topic of ethical values has not been discussed much in Agile practices so far.[^3] The Agile Alliance has a [Code of Conduct](https://www.agilealliance.org/code-of-conduct/). And a blog post on [coaching ethics](https://www.agilealliance.org/identifying-a-code-of-ethical-conduct-for-agile-coaching/) made it to the top 10 of 2022 (Agile Alliance).

[^1]: An ETHICOMP 2022 paper, "From the Page to Practice: Support for Computing Professionals Using a Code of Ethics", makes the case for a proactive approach. It presents a Consider, Analyze, Review, Evaluate (CARE) process. See the [Bibliography](ESE-Literature.md) page.

[^2]: We use the term "software engineer" in a broad sense here, including roles such as requirements engineer, architect, developer, tester, operator and maintainer. The entire software development lifecycle is in scope, with special emphasis on analysis and design.
 
[^3]: For instance, search for terms such as "ethics" on the [website](https://www.agilealliance.org/) of the Agile Alliance.

But what are ethical values? Our glossary references the definitions of the terms [value](/ESE-Glossary.md#value) and [ethical value](/ESE-Glossary.md#ethical-value) from IEEE Std. 7000; the [Merriam-Webster Dictionary](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/ethic) defines the term "ethic".
The following figure shows three different meanings of the term "value", depending on the viewpoint taken:

For additional motivation for ethical software engineering and terminology clarification, please refer to ["Are Programmers Ethically (and Legally) Responsible for Their Code?"](https://thenewstack.io/are-programmers-ethically-and-legally-responsible-for-their-code/), an article by Jennifer Riggins on The New Stack (Aug 16, 2018).

## Goals and Approach

Goals and non-goals: 

* + raise awareness, - allow for ethics washing 
* + stimulate discussions, - over-simplify or reduce time to think and decide 
* + education aid, - command/control tool 
* + decision support, - decision making

Approach: "attention and reflection" are required to become a responsibleSWE; ESE provides motivation, examples, pointers, TODOs for team/roles; but no simple workflow (or even answers) or set of checkbox questions (topic is too complex and too "wicked" for that) or predefine value catalogs with right-wrong intructions, in the spirit of "positive responsibility" (John Ladd, 1993).

## Repository Navigation 

ESE provides new and/or enhanced [practices](./practices/) (i.e., activities and artifacts):

* [Story Valuation](./practices/ESE-StoryValuation.md) activity, ***a good place to get started with ESE***
* [Ethical Review](./practices/ESE-EthicalReview.md) report and meeting
* Extended, value-enhanced [Definition of Ready](./practices/ESE-DefinitionOfReady.md) artifact
* Extended, value-enhanced [Definition of Done](./practices/ESE-DefinitionOfDone.md) artifact
* [Value Retrospective](./practices/ESE-ValueRetrospective.md) activity, inspired by and complementing other forms of retrospectives.

Other folders and pages in this repository include:

* [Roles directory](/roles) (not fully populated at present)
* [Experimentation](/experimentation) instructions (method validation)
* [Future work](/ESE-FutureWork.md)

Other content is linked in the directory-level index pages.


## Prerequisite Knowledge and Background Information

*Working with ESE (the content of this repository) does not assume that you have read the IEEE Std. 7000 end to end.* It is helpful but not required to be familiar with its concepts and processes; these are introduced and/or referenced as needed. 

Experience with the Agile practices that ESE applies, extends or complements is welcome and useful but not strongly required; links and examples provide opportunities to catch up.

The [Background Information](ESE-BackgroundInformation.md) page provides value comparisons and mappings from IEEE Std. 7000 to Agile concepts and practices (and back).
