TODO (v2) bring links back when ok or replace with new ones:

<https://ethicalos.org/> has tools (in narrow sense of the word) and checklists:

This paper (in German) identifies related work, including an Ethics Canvas Manual, a Responsible Design Process, and an EDAP Schema (EDAP is short for "Ethische Deliberation f√ºr agile Prozesse", which translates to "ethical deliberation for agile processes").
