## Related Work and Tools

This paper (in German) identifies related work, including an Ethics Canvas Manual, a Responsible Design Process, and an EDAP Schema (EDAP is short for "Ethische Deliberation für agile Prozesse", which translates to "ethical deliberation for agile processes").

Bertrand Meyer bases ethics on the rules of logical reasoning and proposes three concrete principles:
goodness, truth, and fairness as well as two meta-principles: restraint and importance.
