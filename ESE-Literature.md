## Related Work and Tools

<!-- 

TODO (v2) bring links back when ok or replace with new ones:

<https://ethicalos.org/> has tools (in narrow sense of the word) and checklists:

* <https://ethicalos.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Ethical-OS-Toolkit-2.pdf>
* <https://ethicalos.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/EthicalOS_Check-List_080618.pdf>

The site and its tools are in the process of moving to <https://www.iftf.org/projects/a-playbook-for-ethical-tech-governance/>.

This paper (in German) identifies related work, including an Ethics Canvas Manual, a Responsible Design Process, and an EDAP Schema (EDAP is short for "Ethische Deliberation für agile Prozesse", which translates to "ethical deliberation for agile processes").
