## ESE Glossary

This glossary lists and explains the key terms from IEEE Std. 7000 and from the Agile community that are used in ESE (this repository).

### Overview 

What do the various acronyms mean? 

|TLA | Meaning | Definition (IEEE Std. 7000 unless noted otherwise) | 
|-|-----------------------------------------------------------------|-|
|BAT|Best Available Technique|See IEEE Std. 7000|
|CEP| Context Exploration Process | "The ConOps and Context Exploration Process identifies stakeholders involved with the system throughout its life cycle and chooses representatives. It also analyzes control over the envisaged SOI. It gathers relevant information on the social, legal, and environmental feasibility of the SOI." |
|CoC|Code of Conduct |e.g., ["ACM Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct"](https://www.acm.org/code-of-ethics), IEEE/IEEE CS, GI, SI |
|ConOps| Concept of Operations | "Verbal and/or graphic statement, in broad outline, of an organization’s assumptions or intent in regard to an operation or series of operations" (ISO/IEC/IEEE15288: 2015)|
|DoD| Definition of Done | See entry in [Agile Glossary](https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/definition-of-done/)|
|DoR| Definition of Ready | See entry in [Agile Glossary](https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/definition-of-ready/)|
|ESE| Ethical Software Engineering | The method defined in this repository, comprising new and extended [practices](/practices/) |
|EVR| Ethical Value Requirement | "Organizational or technical requirement catering to values that stakeholders and conceptual value analysis identified as relevant for the SOI." (SOI: System of Interest) |
|INVEST| Independent, Negotiable, Valuable, Estimable, Small, Testable | See [What does INVEST Stand For? (Agile Alliance)](https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/invest/) |
|NFR|Non-Functional Requirement| ISO/IEC 25010:2011, [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-functional_requirement)|
|PBI| Product Backlog Item | Entry in Product Backlog (see overview figure in [practices](/practices/) folder |
| RACI | Responsible, accountable, consulted, informed | Decision making/task management technique ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsibility_assignment_matrix)) | 
|SOI | System of Interest | "System whose life cycle is under consideration" |
|VBSR| Value-Based System Requirement | "System requirement that is traceable from ethical value requirements, value clusters, and core values."|
|VBSE| Value-Based Systems Engineering ||
|VSD| Value-Sensitive Design |Book by Batya Friedman and David G. Hendry|
|tbc| to be continued | There also are TODO markers (in Markdown comments) |

### Benefit

"Positive outcome that is voluntarily or involuntarily created by a system or process." and, in an note: "Benefits correspond to one or more underlying desired values."

### CEP 

"The Context Exploration Process develops an understanding of the ethical environment in which the SOI and its operations impact stakeholders."

### ConOps 

"Verbal and/or graphic statement, in broad outline, of an organization’s assumptions or intent in regard to an operation or series of operations" (ISO/IEC/IEEE15288: 2015)

### Ethical 

IEEE Std. 7000 defines "ethical: Supporting the realization of positive values or the reduction of negative values".

### Ethical Value

IEEE Std. 7000: "ethical value: Value in the context of human culture that supports a judgment on what is right or wrong".

### EVR 

EVR stands for Ethical Value Requirement (EVR). An EVR is an "organizational or technical requirement catering to values that stakeholders and conceptual value analysis identified as relevant for the SOI."

### Harm

"(noun) Negative event or negative social development entailing value damage or loss to people. (verb) Acting with negative value effects for self or others, within a respective SOI, organization, or beyond." <!-- "NOTE — Harms correspond to one or more underlying values." -->

### SOI 

System of Interest, "System whose life cycle is under consideration".

### Value 

"A conception that influences the selection from available modes, means and ends of action".

### Value Cluster 

IEEE Std. 7000 defines: "Group containing one core value and several values instrumental to, or related to, the core value."

In ESE, value clusters can be documented in several ways, for instance as part of Value Trees (see example in Story Valuation). ESE also provides Markdown templates for them.


### Value Register

IEEE Std. 7000 defines: "An information store created for transparency and traceability reasons, which contains data and decisions gained in ethical values elicitation and prioritization and traceability into ethical value requirements." 

A Value Register is one of the outputs of the Clause 8 process "Ethical Values Elicitation and Prioritization Process".

### VBSR 

Value-Based System Requirement, see [overview table](/ESE-Glossary.md#overview).
