# Activities and artifacts in Ethical Software Engineering (ESE)
<!-- 273 words on Oct 25, 2023 -->

ESE extends three existing practices (activities, artifacts) and proposes two new ones. It also uses three existing ones (unchanged). 


## Practice (Activity/Artifact) Index 

ESE includes a total of nine agile activities and artifacts, listed in alphabetical order here (which differs from usage flow):

* (new) [Story Valuation](ESE-StoryValuation.md) activity, ***the entry point for ESE usage***
* (unchanged) Acceptance Testing, see entry in [Agile Alliance Glossary](https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/acceptance)
* (extended artifact) [Definition of Done](ESE-DefinitionOfDone.md) 
* (extended artifact) [Definition of Ready](ESE-DefinitionOfReady.md) 
* (new) [Ethical Review](ESE-EthicalReview.md)
* (unchanged) Product Backlog, see entry in [Agile Alliance Glossary](https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/backlog/) 
* (unchanged) Sprint Planning, see entry in [Agile Alliance Glossary](https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/sprint-planning/)
* (unchanged) User Story, see entry in [Agile Alliance Glossary](https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/user-stories/)
* (extended activity) [Value Retrospective](ESE-ValueRetrospective.md)

The following UML class diagram shows how these method elements relate to each other:

 The inheritance relations (white triangle at arrowhead) indicate whether they are new, enhancing existing ones or used as-is; abstract classes indicate novelty. There are three: "Enhanced Agile Practice," "New Ethical Software Engineering Practice," and "Unchanged Agile Practice". 

Note that the Scrum concept of Product Vision is not explicitly featured here. It is integrated in [Story Valuation](ESE-StoryValuation.md) and mapped in the [Background Information](/ESE-BackgroundInformation.md) though.

## Process and Information Flow (IEEE 7000) 

The following figure shows how the IEEE Std. 7000 concepts are logically connected with each other and with design decisions (yielding a practice usage flow):

<!-- note: figure also used in ESE-BackgroundInformation.md -->

EVR stands for [Ethical Value Requirement](/ESE-Glossary.md#evr), VBSR for [Value-Based System Requirement](/ESE-Glossary.md#vbsr).
