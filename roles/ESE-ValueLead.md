Role: *Value Lead*
------------------

The value lead is a "person assigned to coordinate and conduct tasks related to ethical values elicitation and prioritization and traceability of values through the requirements and design artifacts." (Source: IEEE Std. 7000)

### Persona 

"The Value Lead focuses on the identification, analysis, and prioritization of ethical values and their incorporation in the system design. The Value Lead is not “the person in charge of ethics” in a project but contributes subject matter expertise and facilitative skills, bridging gaps between engineering, management, and ethical values in a constructive way." (Source: IEEE Std. 7000)

### Information and Modeling Need

Section 6.2.3 on page 33 in IEEE Std. 7000 defines: 

"The responsibilities of the Value Lead include the following:  
a) Organizes, analyzes, communicates, and records ethical and/or value related concepts, concerns, activities and decisions in a project  
b) Facilitates discussions and value-related activities to accompany a project in its design efforts
c) Builds compromises through practices like participatory design"  

### Hints 

Note that Value Lead may also be a shared responsibility of all team members, as agile architecting often is; it does not always have to be a role. Such a distributed approach with collective ownership promises to have benefits such as improved scope and quality of [Value Register](/ESE-Glossary.md#value-register) and [Value Requirements](/ESE-Glossary.md#evr). However, there also is risk attached to it: the responsibilities and their importance and urgency might get forgotten when development workload and pressure to deliver increase; team members might also simply hope that somebody else will take care of them (leading to infinite loops or Gordian Knots). <!-- note: standard explicitly says "person" on page 23 (this approach also has risks) -->

### Collaborations

Roles to communicate with: 

* [Product Manager](ESE-ProductManager.md)
* [User Advocate](ESE-UserAdvocate.md) 
* All other roles 

### Consumed/Produced Artifacts and Applied Techniques/Practices

* All [activities and artifacts ](/practices/)
