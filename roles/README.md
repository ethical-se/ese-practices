# Roles in ethical-software-engineering (ESE)

## Overview 

*Note:* ESE does not introduce new specific roles. At present, not many existing roles are  modeled in ESE; three skeletons are available: 

* [Product Manager](ESE-ProductManager.md)
* [User Advocate](ESE-UserAdvocate.md) 
* [Value Lead](ESE-ValueLead.md) 

IEEE Std. 7000 also has: Top Management Champion, System Expert, Risk Lead, Moderator, Transparency Manager.

<!-- TODO (v2) could present a user story or persona per role -->


## Mapping of Agile Roles to IEEE Std. 7000

*Note:* The following mapping are not meant to be direct, obvious correspondences but proposals.

| Scrum [role](https://resources.scrumalliance.org/Article/scrum-team) | IEEE 7000 (Section 6.2) | Comments |
|-|-|-|
| Product Owner | Senior Product Manager, Risk Lead, User Advocate | Risk of goal conflicts? |
| Developer | System Expert | Team competencies as well (from Section 6.3 of IEEE 7000) | 
| Scrum Master | Value Lead, Moderator | Value Lead might be better placed elsewhere (tbd) |

No direct correspondence (in Scrum): Top Management Champion, Transparency Manager, User Advocate. Note that having an end user on the team is a general Agile principle originating from XP.  


## ESE Practices

Start browsing the ESE activities and artifacts [here](/practices/README.md).

W.r.t. processes, ConOps (IEEE Srd. 7000) and Product Vision (Scrum) have a strong correspondence.
