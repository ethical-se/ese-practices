## Future Work 

* Provide more application/adoption [examples](/examples/)
* Enhance Markdown [templates](/templates/) and integrate ESE into description formats such as arc42
* Validate all method content further (see [experimentation](/experimentation/) page)
* Improve existing or add new notations, e.g. Value Tree (already featured in an example), Value Canvas or Value Mapping <!-- [O] QOC+, bipartite graph? --> 
* Discuss what Enterprise Architecture Management (EAM) can add (TOGAF, Zachman, etc.): ConOps input?
* Scaling ESE: many epics and stories, large and heterogeneous stakeholder landscape, many and many conflicting values, ...  
* Look at other agile practices: story points, planning poker?
* More emphasis on design decisions: ethical decision making and recording, value-based decision rationale ("Y+", extension to MADR template and its explanations)
* More emphasis on design process and phases (SOI as value bearer, value disposition): map software quality attributes to values and back (Annex G), value-based architectural modeling, architectural components supporting Transparency Management <!-- [O] extension to ADD? QOC? Decision making methods? -->
* *to be continued*
